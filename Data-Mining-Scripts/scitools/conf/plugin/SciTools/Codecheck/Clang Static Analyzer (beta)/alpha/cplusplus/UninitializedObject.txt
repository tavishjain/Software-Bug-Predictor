(C++) This checker reports uninitialized fields in objects created after a constructor call. It doesn't only find direct uninitialized fields, but rather makes a deep inspection of the object, analyzing all of it's fields subfields. The checker regards inherited fields as direct fields, so one will recieve warnings for uninitialized inherited data members as well.
